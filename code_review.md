## 2026-07-01 - Per-user connector grant / OAuth token vault

- Result:
  - Found that token issuance and grant status changes relied too much on callers passing a previously authorized `grantId`. The domain service did not independently re-check that the grant belonged to the acting user, tenant, connector, and token reference before loading the token vault. In an enterprise environment this is a defense-in-depth gap: a future integration bug could turn a valid grant id into cross-user delegated mailbox access.
  - Found that initial OAuth token exchange accepted missing `refresh_token` and did not reject provider-returned scopes that were wider than the scopes requested through state. For long-lived delegated access, both should fail closed.
- Fix applied:
  - `ConnectorGrantService` now reloads and verifies grant ownership before token resolution, revoke, and expiry marking.
  - OAuth exchange now requires `access_token` and `refresh_token`, and rejects unrequested provider scopes.
  - OAuth refresh now requires a returned `access_token`.
  - Tool broker and connector-grant action/smoke callers now pass explicit tenant/user expectations.
  - Added deterministic per-user connector tests for the token ownership invariant.
- Business impact:
  - Reduces the risk that one user's delegated Gmail/Workspace token can be used by another user or tenant because of a caller-side bug.
  - Keeps delegated grants least-privilege even if an OAuth provider response is malformed or unexpectedly broad.
  - Moves critical access-control rules into the domain layer, where enterprise audit and runtime paths share the same invariant.
