## 2026-07-06 - Model Gateway governed routing / request model override

- Reviewed modules:
  - `app/src/domain/gateway/model-gateway.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/gateway/routing-engine.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/gateway/sensitivity-router.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/gateway/budget-engine.ts`
  - `app/src/app/api/v1/gateway/v1/chat/completions/route.ts`
  - `app/src/lib/harness-model-config.ts`
  - `app/scripts/model-gateway-negative.test.ts`
- Result:
  - The Model Gateway already centralizes provider calls, sensitivity classification, budget guardrails, model-call audit records, and provider abstraction in a shape that is appropriate for enterprise control-plane enforcement.
  - Found a governance bypass in the OpenAI-compatible gateway API path. A caller-provided `model` value was merged into `modelConfig` before entering the gateway, so the routing engine treated it as the agent's registry model. Without an explicit routing policy this let a request choose another model identifier, which can bypass central cost, vendor, residency, and approval expectations.
  - Found that the routing engine's `overrideHint` contract was documented as low trust but, if used, would have accepted the override before policy evaluation. That is the wrong default for an enterprise AI gateway because request-level preferences must be opt-in governance decisions, not caller authority.
- Fix applied:
  - Request-selected models now travel as `modelOverrideHint` instead of overwriting the agent registry `modelConfig`.
  - `RoutingEngine` ignores request model overrides by default and honors them only when the matched routing policy explicitly sets `allowRequestOverride: true`; optional provider/model allowlists further constrain which override can be used.
  - The `/api/v1/gateway/v1/chat/completions` response now reports the actual model used by the gateway, so clients and audit evidence do not claim that a denied override was honored.
  - Added MG-N7 negative tests covering default-deny override behavior, explicitly allowlisted override behavior, and denied unallowlisted override behavior.
- Business impact:
  - Prevents API clients, harnesses, or compromised agents from silently switching to unapproved, more expensive, or non-compliant model backends.
  - Keeps model routing, vendor selection, and data-governance decisions in the platform control plane where administrators can review and audit them.
  - Improves customer-facing transparency by returning the actual model that processed the request.

## 2026-07-01 - Per-user connector grant / OAuth token vault

- Reviewed modules:
  - `app/src/domain/connector-grant/connector-grant-service.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/connector-grant/grant-token-vault.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/connector-grant/gmail-scopes.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/connector-grant/gmail-api-client.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/tool-broker/tool-broker-service.ts` delegated Gmail/token integration
  - `app/src/app/actions/connector-grants.ts`
  - `app/src/app/api/connectors/oauth/callback/route.ts`
  - `app/src/repositories/postgres/connector-grant-repository.ts`
  - `app/prisma/schema.prisma` `ConnectorGrant` model
  - `app/scripts/per-user-connector.test.ts`, `app/scripts/s7-live-smoke.ts`, `app/scripts/acceptance-e2e.ts`
- Result:
  - Found that token issuance and grant status changes relied too much on callers passing a previously authorized `grantId`. The domain service did not independently re-check that the grant belonged to the acting user, tenant, connector, and token reference before loading the token vault. In an enterprise environment this is a defense-in-depth gap: a future integration bug could turn a valid grant id into cross-user delegated mailbox access.
  - Found that initial OAuth token exchange accepted missing `refresh_token` and did not reject provider-returned scopes that were wider than the scopes requested through state. For long-lived delegated access, both should fail closed.
- Fix applied:
  - `ConnectorGrantService` now reloads and verifies grant ownership before token resolution, revoke, and expiry marking.
  - OAuth exchange now requires `access_token` and `refresh_token`, and rejects unrequested provider scopes.
  - OAuth refresh now requires a returned `access_token`.
  - Tool broker and connector-grant action/smoke callers now pass explicit tenant/user expectations.
  - Added deterministic per-user connector tests for the token ownership invariant.
- Business impact:
  - Reduces the risk that one user's delegated Gmail/Workspace token can be used by another user or tenant because of a caller-side bug.
  - Keeps delegated grants least-privilege even if an OAuth provider response is malformed or unexpectedly broad.
  - Moves critical access-control rules into the domain layer, where enterprise audit and runtime paths share the same invariant.

## 2026-07-04 - Web fetch / egress guard SSRF boundary

- Reviewed modules:
  - `app/src/domain/net/egress-guard.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/web-fetch/web-fetch-service.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/web-fetch/content-sanitize.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/web-fetch/web-fetch-types.ts`
  - `app/src/domain/index.ts` production `WebFetchService` DNS resolver wiring
  - `app/scripts/egress-guard.test.ts`
  - `app/scripts/web-fetch.test.ts`
- Result:
  - The web fetch path already had the right enterprise shape: deny-by-default source URL checks, HTTPS-only fetches, manual redirect handling, content-type and size caps, hash-only audit metadata, and production DNS resolution before fetch.
  - Found a defense-in-depth gap in the resolved-IP classifier. It blocked common private ranges but did not cover several reserved IPv4 ranges, IPv6 documentation/transition/multicast prefixes, or compressed IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms such as `::ffff:a9fe:a9fe`. In production, that could let an allowlisted hostname that resolves unexpectedly to a special-use address get further than intended before the network layer fails or behaves inconsistently.
- Fix applied:
  - IP literal host detection now uses Node's IP parser, so bracketed IPv6 literals are rejected as raw IP hosts as well as IPv4 literals.
  - DNS rebinding checks now classify broader IPv4 reserved ranges and IPv6 loopback, ULA, link-local, multicast, documentation, transition, IPv4-mapped, IPv4-compatible, and NAT64 metadata/private forms.
  - Added egress guard and web fetch tests for IPv6-mapped metadata resolution and additional reserved ranges.
- Business impact:
  - Reduces the chance that AI-driven web discovery can be abused to reach cloud metadata services, internal networks, or special-use network ranges through DNS tricks.
  - Makes the documented "reserved IP re-check" behavior match the actual runtime behavior more closely, which is important for enterprise security review and audit evidence.
  - Keeps the mitigation in the shared server-side egress guard, so callers cannot accidentally bypass it by constructing a different web fetch flow.
